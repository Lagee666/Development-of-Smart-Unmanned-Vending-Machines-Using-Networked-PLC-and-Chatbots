# Development-of-Smart-Unmanned-Vending-Machines-Using-Networked-PLC-and-Chatbots

## Introduction
Due to the increasing labor cost, many companies tend to develop unmanned technologies. This project creates a smart unmanned vending machine using networked programmable logic controllers (PLC) and chatbots. The developed unmanned vending machine consists of three components, including a self-checkout system, a smart warehousing system, and a monitoring system. The self-checkout system is built by the proximity switches on the shelves with calculating the total cost of the buying items. The warehousing system is mainly regulated by a networked PLC as a controller with a connection to the internet. The monitoring system is mainly presented by chatbots used on smartphones. This project combines RFID, PLC, and chatbots to create a smart unmanned vending machine.
